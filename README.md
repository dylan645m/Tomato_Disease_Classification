Credits:https://github.com/codebasics dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village
## **Goals**
- Create a **deep learning classification** for the Tomato Dieases dataset, Using the Tensorflow and Keras python packages.
- Create a neutral network using **convolution neural network and pooling** to learn and identify the different diseases in tomatos.
# **Outcome**
Created and trained a machine learn model to predict tomato diseases with **97.19% accuracy.**

# **Final Results**

Shows one batch of pictures with its actual class and the class the model predicted, as well as its confidence on its prediction.

# **Model Results Details**

Below are two graphs showing how the model was trained over its 30 iterations
<br>
The blue line represents the training the model did compared the orange line is the validation
<br>
which is what the model used to test its training results on
